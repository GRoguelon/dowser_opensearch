defmodule Dowser.Opensearch.Streamer do
  @moduledoc """
  Turns a search into an Elixir `Stream`, for walking more documents than fit
  in one response.

      %{query: %{match_all: %{}}, size: 1_000, sort: [%{"_id" => "asc"}]}
      |> Dowser.Opensearch.Streamer.stream(index: "posts")
      |> Stream.map(& &1["_source"])
      |> Enum.each(&process/1)

  Each element is a hit — `_index`, `_id`, `_source` and the rest — cast
  exactly as `Dowser.Opensearch.Search.search/2` would cast it.

  ## How it walks

  A [point in time](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/api-reference/search-apis/point-in-time-api/)
  pins the index against concurrent writes, and `search_after` pages through
  it, taking each page's cursor from the last hit of the page before it.

  `search_after` is sequential by construction, so one stream cannot fetch
  pages in parallel. `stream_slices/4` is how you get parallelism; see below.

  ## The sort is yours to give

  **`:sort` is required in the query**, and its last key must be unique per
  document.

  This is the one place this module differs from `dowser_elasticsearch`, and
  the difference comes from OpenSearch rather than from taste. Elasticsearch
  has a `_shard_doc` sort field — shard index plus Lucene document id — that
  exists precisely to tiebreak a point-in-time walk, so the Elasticsearch
  streamer appends it for you and needs no sort from the caller. OpenSearch
  forked before `_shard_doc` was introduced and never added it, and there is
  nothing in its sort vocabulary that plays the same role: `_doc` is a
  *per-shard* document id, so the same value occurs once per shard, and
  `search_after` on a non-unique final key silently skips or repeats the
  documents that share it.

  A guessed default would therefore be a walk that quietly loses documents on
  any multi-shard index, so this module asks instead. `_id` is always unique
  and needs no mapping change:

      %{query: %{match_all: %{}}, sort: [%{"_id" => "asc"}]}

  Sorting on `_id` loads its field data, which costs memory on a large index;
  where you have a unique, indexed field of your own — a monotonic id, a
  timestamp *plus* a tiebreaker — prefer it:

      %{query: ..., sort: [%{"created_at" => "asc"}, %{"_id" => "asc"}]}

  If your cluster does serve `_shard_doc`, pass it yourself — nothing here
  rejects it.

  ## Options

    * `:index` — the index to open the point in time on. Required unless
      `:pit` is given. It is *not* sent with the searches themselves:
      OpenSearch rejects a search that names both an index and a PIT.
    * `:pit` — an existing point-in-time id to walk instead of opening one.
      It is checked once before the walk starts, and left open afterwards —
      whoever opened it closes it. Without it, the stream opens its own and
      closes it when enumeration ends, however it ends.
    * `:keep_alive` — how long OpenSearch holds the point in time, extended
      on every search. Defaults to `"1m"`. Long enough to cover the gap
      between two pages, not the whole walk.
    * `:verify_pit` — whether a `:pit` you passed is checked before the walk
      starts. `true` by default; `false` when you just opened it and know it
      is alive.

  Everything else is forwarded to `Dowser.Opensearch.Search`, so `:context`,
  `:codec`, `:keys` and `:http_opts` all work as usual.

  A query with no `size` gets 1000, not OpenSearch's default of 10 — at 10 hits
  per round trip a million documents is a hundred thousand requests. Set your
  own when you have a reason to.

  ## Slicing

  `stream_slices/4` splits the point in time into disjoint subsets and walks
  them at once. OpenSearch divides first across shards, then within each shard
  by contiguous ranges of Lucene document ids, so the natural ceiling is your
  shard count — more slices than shards subdivides a shard rather than adding
  parallelism.

      %{query: %{match_all: %{}}, size: 1_000, sort: [%{"_id" => "asc"}]}
      |> Dowser.Opensearch.Streamer.stream_slices(4, &Enum.count/1, index: "posts")
      |> Enum.sum()

  Note what it takes: a function, not a stream. Each slice is consumed inside
  its own task, because a lazy stream handed back out of a task would run
  every page in the caller — concurrent in name only.

  To spread a walk across *nodes* instead, open the point in time yourself and
  give each node one slice. `slice` is an ordinary search body field, so it
  goes in the query rather than the options:

      stream(%{query: ..., sort: ..., slice: %{id: 2, max: 8}}, pit: pit_id)

  ## Failure

  There is no `stream!/2`. Every other function in this package comes in a pair
  because it returns `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, error}` and the bang variant
  unwraps it; a stream has nothing to unwrap, and nothing has happened yet when
  it is built. Errors surface on enumeration, by raising — which is what the
  bang variant would have done anyway.

  A missing `:sort` is the exception: that is a mistake in the call rather than
  a failure of the cluster, so it raises when the stream is *built*, not when
  it is walked.

  The stream raises on the first failed request, and closes a point in time it
  opened on the way out — on normal completion, on `Enum.take/2`, and on an
  exception. It cannot close one if the enumerating process is killed outright;
  `:keep_alive` is the backstop there.

  Walks `slice_nbr` slices of one point in time at once, running `stream_fn`
  over each.

  Both are positional because both are required: there is no sensible default
  for how many slices to open — the useful number is your shard count, which
  this cannot know — and a function is what the whole call is for.

  Note what it yields: one result per *slice*, not a stream of hits like
  `stream/2`. The hits are `stream_fn`'s to consume.

  `stream_fn` receives a slice's stream and is called **inside** the task that
  owns it, so the hits never cross a process boundary — which is the whole
  point: returning a lazy stream from a task would build it there and then run
  every page back in the caller.

      %{query: %{match_all: %{}}, size: 1_000, sort: [%{"_id" => "asc"}]}
      |> Dowser.Opensearch.Streamer.stream_slices(4, &Enum.count/1, index: "posts")
      |> Enum.sum()

  The result is a stream of whatever `stream_fn` returned, one per slice, so
  keep those small — a count, a sum, `:ok`. A slice that returns everything it
  read defeats the streaming.

  A `slice` already in the query body is the base every slice is built on, so
  anything else the split needs travels with it; `id` and `max` are computed
  here and win:

      stream_slices(%{query: ..., sort: ..., slice: %{field: "_id"}}, 7, &f/1, index: "posts")
      # each walk carries %{"field" => "_id", "id" => 0..6, "max" => 7}

  All slices share one point in time, opened here and closed when the stream
  finishes, however it finishes. Pass `:pit` to use one of your own; it is
  checked once, and left open.

  ## Options

  Takes everything `stream/2` does, plus:

    * `:max_concurrency` — how many slices run at once. Defaults to
      `slice_nbr`, so every slice you asked for is actually in flight.

      Note this is *not* `Task.async_stream/3`'s default of
      `System.schedulers_online/0`, nor capped by it. A slice spends its time
      waiting on OpenSearch, and a process blocked on a socket occupies no
      scheduler — so the limit that matters is what the cluster will take, not
      how many cores this machine has. Capping 32 slices at 10 schedulers
      makes the walk four times slower for nothing.

      Lower it when `stream_fn` is the expensive part rather than the
      fetching, or to be gentler on the cluster.
    * `:timeout` — per slice, not per request. Defaults to `:infinity`, since
      a slice runs as long as it takes to walk; `Task.async_stream/3` would
      otherwise give up after five seconds.
    * `:ordered` — `false` by default, so a finished slice is not held back by
      a slower one.

  A slice that fails raises: an exception from its own walk, or a
  `RuntimeError` naming the slice if the task exited or timed out.
