defmodule Dowser.Opensearch.Codec do
  @moduledoc """
  Casts OpenSearch documents and search results to and from native Elixir
  terms, based on each document's own index mapping — a `Dowser.Client`
  `:decoder` *and* `:encoder`:

      config :dowser_client,
        contexts: [
          default: [
            endpoint: "http://localhost:9200",
            decoder: Dowser.Opensearch.Codec,
            encoder: Dowser.Opensearch.Codec
          ]
        ]

  Once configured, every API function in `Dowser.Opensearch.Document` and
  `Dowser.Opensearch.Search` casts automatically — no per-call option needed.
  Mappings are fetched (and cached) through `Dowser.Opensearch.MappingCacher`.

  The module works at two levels, and its two pairs of functions say which:

    * `decode/2` and `encode/2` take a **whole body**, and are what
      `dowser_client` calls.
    * `load/2` and `dump/2` take **one value** and the mapping entry that
      describes it, and are what the body pass dispatches into, field by
      field. They are also this module's behaviour.

  ## decode/2

  Finds and casts every document in a response body, at any nesting depth:
  a bare document (`Dowser.Opensearch.Document.get/3`), `hits.hits[]`
  (`Dowser.Opensearch.Search.search/2`), `responses[].hits.hits[]`
  (`Dowser.Opensearch.Search.msearch/2`), and so on — each hit's own
  `_index` selects its mapping, so mixed-index results are cast correctly.

  A hit's `inner_hits` are cast too. They carry no `_index` of their own, so
  their mapping comes from the hit they belong to: `_nested.field` names the
  path into it, and an inner hit with no `_nested` (a `has_child` or
  `has_parent` join) is cast against the index mapping itself. The rest of a
  hit's envelope — `fields`, `highlight`, `sort` — has no mapping entry to be
  cast against, and only has its keys run through `opts[:key_fn]`.

  If no mapping can be found for a document's index (no
  `Dowser.Opensearch.MappingCacher` running, or the fetch fails), its values
  pass through unchanged; keys are still cast per `opts[:key_fn]`.

  ### Subtrees the mapping declares opaque

  A `flat_object` field (OpenSearch's name for Elasticsearch's `flattened`),
  and an object mapped `"enabled": false`, hold whatever the document put in
  them — the mapping enumerates none of it. Both are returned exactly as they
  arrived: values uncast, and keys left as strings rather than run through
  `opts[:key_fn]`.

  That last part matters under `keys: :atoms`. Atoms are never garbage
  collected and the table is capped (`:erlang.system_info(:atom_limit)`, a
  little over a million by default); atomizing keys that come from document
  content rather than from the mapping turns any writer into a way to exhaust
  it and bring the node down. A mapped field's name is one of a finite set, so
  casting it is safe; a `flat_object` field's keys are not.

  A mixed result is the price: `%{title: "hi", roster: %{"Managed Care Biller"
  => "Sam"}}`. The alternative is a cast that is unsafe by construction.

  Note that this is narrower than the whole risk. `keys: :atoms` also casts
  keys the mapping simply doesn't mention — an unmapped field under
  `"dynamic": false`, or one added since the mapping was cached. Where a body
  is wholly untrusted, `keys: :atoms!` (`String.to_existing_atom/1`) is the
  option that cannot grow the table at all.

  ## encode/2

  Casts one **document source** against the mapping of `opts[:index]` — never a
  query. `dowser_client` only hands an encoder a source, because a query value
  has no mapping entry to anchor it: the same value can appear in a range
  clause, a script parameter or an aggregation boundary, each wanting a
  different shape. Build queries in the shape OpenSearch expects.

  `encode_bulk/3` is the exception to one-source-at-a-time: a bulk payload is
  cast against the index named on the action line above it, which no per-line
  pass can see.

  ## load/2 and dump/2

  The mapping entry's `"type"` selects the field codec that handles it; only
  the types JSON can't natively represent are cast, and any other entry — like
  a `nil` value — falls back to identity.

  | mapping type           | field codec                            | Elixir term    |
  | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
  | `date`, `date_nanos`   | `Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.Date`         | `DateTime`     |
  | `date_range`           | `Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.DateRange`    | `Date.Range`   |
  | `integer_range`        | `Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.Range`        | `Range`        |
  | `ip`                   | `Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.IP`           | `:inet` tuple  |
  | `binary`               | `Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.Binary`       | raw binary     |
  | `geo_point`            | `Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.GeoPoint`     | `{lat, lon}`   |

      iex> Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.load("127.0.0.1", %{"type" => "ip"})
      {127, 0, 0, 1}

      iex> Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.dump({127, 0, 0, 1}, %{"type" => "ip"})
      "127.0.0.1"

  ## The behaviour

  `load/2` and `dump/2` are the callbacks each field codec in the table
  implements: two functions over one value and the mapping entry describing it
  (`field`), returning the cast term directly. A value a codec doesn't
  recognize should pass through unchanged rather than raise, so a bad cast
  degrades to identity instead of failing the whole document.

  ## Adding mapping types

  A codec is a plain module, so covering one more type is a clause per
  direction and a delegation back here for everything else:

      defmodule MyApp.Codec do
        @behaviour Dowser.Opensearch.Codec

        @impl true
        def load(value, %{"type" => "my_type"} = field) do
          # ...
        end

        def load(value, field), do: Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.load(value, field)

        @impl true
        def dump(value, %{"type" => "my_type"} = field) do
          # ...
        end

        def dump(value, field), do: Dowser.Opensearch.Codec.dump(value, field)
      end

  Delegating last inherits the built-in casts — including the `nil`
  short-circuit and the fall-through to identity, so neither needs restating.
  Matching a type this module already handles *replaces* that cast (e.g. to
  handle a custom date `format`), since your clause comes first.

  A module like that only needs `load/2` and `dump/2`: the envelope walking
  stays here, and `:codec` points `decode/2`/`encode/2` at it. It resolves
  most-specific-first, like every other option in this package:

    1. **Per request** — `:codec` alongside any other option:

           Dowser.Opensearch.Document.get("posts", "1", codec: MyApp.Codec)

    2. **Per context** — named alongside the pass it belongs to:

           decoder: {Dowser.Opensearch.Codec, codec: MyApp.Codec},
           encoder: {Dowser.Opensearch.Codec, codec: MyApp.Codec}

    3. **Globally** — the usual place for an application with one codec, and
       the only tier that needs no tuple:

           config :dowser_opensearch, codec: MyApp.Codec

    4. This module, when none of the above is set.

  ## Options

  `dowser_client` always supplies `:context` (the resolved
  `Dowser.Client.Context`), and a decoder also gets `:key_fn` (the function
  `:keys` resolved to). The rest are this module's own, given alongside it as
  `{Dowser.Opensearch.Codec, opts}`:

    * `:codec` — the field codec `load/2`/`dump/2` are dispatched through, as
      above.
    * `:index` — the index whose mapping `encode/2` casts a source against, and
      that `decode/2` casts a `:source` body against. Set by the API function
      itself.
    * `:source` — `true` when a response body is a bare `_source` document with
      no `_index` of its own (`Dowser.Opensearch.Document.get_source/3`).
      Set by the API function itself.
    * `:mapping` — a mapping to cast against, instead of looking one up. Skips
      `Dowser.Opensearch.MappingCacher` entirely.
    * `:mapping_failure` — what to do when a mapping *cannot be fetched*; see
      below. Defaults to the application environment
      (`config :dowser_opensearch, mapping_failure: ...`), itself `:error`.

  ## When the mapping can't be fetched

  An index with no mapping, and no index to speak of, both cast to identity:
  there is nothing to dispatch on, and that is a correct answer.

  A mapping that could not be *fetched* is a different thing. The fetch is an
  OpenSearch request like any other, so it fails when the cluster is
  overloaded — and casting to identity there means the same field comes back as
  a `Date.Range` on a good day and a `%{"gte" => _, "lte" => _}` on a bad one,
  a document source is written with a `Date.Range` the JSON encoder chokes on,
  and nothing says so. `:mapping_failure` decides what happens instead:

    * `:error` (default) — raise `Dowser.Opensearch.MappingError`, which
      `dowser_client` turns into the `{:error, exception}` every API function
      already returns. The request fails; the types don't drift.
    * `:warn` — log a warning and cast to identity.
    * `:ignore` — cast to identity, silently.

  Where `:telemetry` is available — an optional dependency, so only if your
  application already pulls it in — every failed fetch also emits
  `[:dowser_opensearch, :mapping, :failure]` whatever the policy, with
  `%{index: index, reason: reason, policy: policy}` as metadata: the place to
  count them without a log line per document.
