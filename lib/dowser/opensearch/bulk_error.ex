defmodule Dowser.Opensearch.BulkError do
  @moduledoc """
  The partial failure of a `Dowser.Opensearch.Document.bulk/2` request.

  A bulk request is never all-or-nothing: OpenSearch answers `200 OK` with
  `"errors" => true` and reports the outcome of each action separately, so a
  request in which half the documents were rejected looks, at the HTTP level,
  exactly like one in which every document was indexed. `bulk/2` therefore
  returns `{:error, %#{inspect(__MODULE__)}{}}` whenever any item failed, and
  this exception carries what failed and what did not:

    * `:items` — every item of the response, in request order.
    * `:failed` — one entry per failed item (see below).
    * `:succeeded` — how many items were applied.
    * `:retryable` — the operations of the items OpenSearch *rejected*
      (per-item `429`/`503`), as a flat list ready to hand back to `bulk/2`.
      Resubmitting these re-applies only what was never applied, where
      resending the whole payload would write the successful items twice.
    * `:took` and `:body` — the response's `took` and the whole decoded body.

  Each `:failed` entry is a map:

      %{
        position: 3,              # 0-based index into the response items
        action: "index",          # "index" | "create" | "update" | "delete"
        index: "posts",
        id: "42",
        status: 429,
        operation: [%{index: %{_index: "posts", _id: "42"}}, %{title: "hi"}],
        error: %Dowser.Opensearch.Error{}
      }

  `:operation` holds the action line and its payload as they were given to
  `bulk/2` — `nil` when the response has more items than the request had
  actions, which shouldn't happen but isn't worth crashing over.

  ## Example

      case Dowser.Opensearch.Document.bulk(operations, index: "posts") do
        {:ok, _body} ->
          :ok

        {:error, %Dowser.Opensearch.BulkError{retryable: [_ | _] = operations}} ->
          # OpenSearch rejected some items under load: resubmit just those,
          # after backing off.
          Dowser.Opensearch.Document.bulk(operations, index: "posts")

        {:error, error} ->
          {:error, error}
      end
